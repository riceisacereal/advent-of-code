## Part 1
When shooting the probe upwards at `n` velocity, the probe falls back to
the starting y level at `2n + 1` steps with `-n` velocity.\
I sucked at physics in middle school, so it took me some time to figure this
one out (I am really dumb).
Therefore, at `2n + 2` steps, the probe will be at a y-level of `- (n + 1)`,
therefore we take the lowest y position

## Part 2
n(n + 1) / 2
(end - start)(start + end) / 2
