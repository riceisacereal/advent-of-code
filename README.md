# Advent of Code


Going through previous events slowly, just for fun.\
Currently trying to write 2021 in Python until my
Object-Oriented brain can't think of a non-OOP implementation
and surrenders to Java.

Added a notes.md to some days when I thought I had a pretty cool idea.\
Days with notes have a "_n" appended in the directory name, like "DayX_n".
